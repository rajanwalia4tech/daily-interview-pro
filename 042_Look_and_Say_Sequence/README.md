# Look
Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

By the way, check out our NEW project AlgoPro (http://algopro.com) for over 60+ video coding sessions with ex-Google/ex-Facebook engineers.

A look-and-say sequence is defined as the integer sequence beginning with a single digit in which the next term is obtained by describing the previous term. An example is easier to understand:

Each consecutive value describes the prior value.
```
1      #
11     # one 1's
21     # two 1's
1211   # one 2, and one 1.
111221 # #one 1, one 2, and two 1's.
```
Your task is, return the nth term of this sequence.
