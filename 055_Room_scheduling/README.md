# Room Scheduling
Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Google:

You are given an array of tuples (start, end) representing time intervals for lectures. The intervals may be overlapping. Return the number of rooms that are required.

For example. [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)] should return 2.
